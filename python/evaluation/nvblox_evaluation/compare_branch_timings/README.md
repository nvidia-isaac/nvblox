# Compare Branch Timings

This folder contains a script: `compare_branch_timings.py` which generates a graph comparing nvblox timings on the 3DMatch dataset which are generated by running the current branch and another branch.

Typically this is used to assess the effects on timing of the changes on the current branch to the state of the repo on `main`.

An example of how to use this script to compare the timings across 5 runs of the mit studyroom sequence.
```bash
./compare_branch_timings.py ~/datasets/3dmatch/sun3d-mit_76_studyroom-76-1studyroom2/ main --num_runs 5
```
